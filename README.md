**Technical Challenges**

Console-Based UI: Formatting output for structured data representation.

Data Consistency: Preventing duplicate entries and handling invalid inputs.

Version Control: Managing Git repositories and resolving merge conflicts effectively.

**Future Enhancements**

GUI implementation using Java Swing or JavaFX.

Role-based access control for users and administrators.

Persistent data storage using databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

REST API integration for remote access and scalability.

Automated testing framework for continuous integration.

**Reflection on Development Challenges**

During the development process, some key challenges included managing user input validation, 
ensuring a structured and modularized codebase, and maintaining a clear project structure. 
Given more time, improvements could include enhancing exception handling, implementing a GUI, and adding persistent data storage using file handling.
